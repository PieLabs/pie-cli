# pack 
---

Generate javascript files containing all the logic needed to render the question.

By default it generates: 
 * `pie-view.js` - contains all the logic for rendering, includes the individual pies, a pie-player, pie-controller and pie-control-panel. 
 * `pie-controller.js` - contains a map of pie names to their controllers, exports the map to either `window` or `exports`.

You can also generate a single js file that defines a custom element with everything pre-defined by adding `--includeComplete | -C`.

### Options

  <%= loadFile('common-opts.md') %>
  `--keepBuildAssets` - keep supporting build assets (like node_modules etc) after packing has completed - default: `false`
  `--manifestOutfile` - where to write out the manifest.json default: `null`
  `--includeComplete` | `-C` - generate a single js file that defines a custom element with everything predefined - default: `false`
  `--questionItemTagName` - if building using `--includeComplete` - this is the name of the custom element that is created. default: `pie-item`
  `--questionExample` - if building using `--includeComplete` - this is the name of the example markup file that is created. default: `example.html` 

### Examples
```shell
pie-cli pack --dir ../path/to/dir
```
