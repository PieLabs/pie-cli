# info 
---

Run a server that'll load an info page about the pie. The info page will contain: 

* README.md
* Schemas
* A Demo

This command should be run at the root of a pie (or use `--dir` to point to the root of a pie).

> Note: For this command to run the build assets need to be present. So after you stop the command these files will be in the directory. To remove them run `pie clean -a info`. We'll add a feature soon to automatically remove them when the server is stopped.

## Options
<%= loadFile('common-opts.md') %>
  `--port` - the port to use - default `4000`
  
## Examples

```shell
cd pie-root
pie info 
```
--
```shell
pie info --dir ../path/pie-root
```
